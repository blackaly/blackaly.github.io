        <p>We are told that we must choose. Either we embrace the new and cast off the old, or we cling to tradition and reject progress. This is a false choice.</p>
<p>The wisest cultures have always known how to hold both. They honor what has been proven by time while remaining open to genuine improvement. They distinguish between change for its own sake and change that serves human flourishing.</p>
<h2 id="the-weight-of-inheritance">The Weight of Inheritance</h2>
<p>To inherit a tradition is to receive a gift and a responsibility. Those who came before us labored to understand the world. They made mistakes, but they also discovered truths. To dismiss their work is arrogance.</p>
<p>Yet inheritance is not passive. Each generation must make the tradition its own. We question, we test, we adapt. What cannot survive scrutiny is rightly discarded. What endures is strengthened.</p>
<h2 id="the-modern-temptation">The Modern Temptation</h2>
<p>Modernity tempts us with the myth of progress. It whispers that the new is always better, that history moves inevitably toward improvement. But a glance at the twentieth century should cure us of this delusion.</p>
<p>Not all change is progress. Some is mere novelty. Some is decline. Wisdom lies in discernment—in knowing what to preserve and what to release.</p>
<h2 id="a-middle-way">A Middle Way</h2>
<p>The task before us is neither reaction nor revolution. It is the patient work of stewardship. We tend what we have received. We improve where we can. We pass on to our children something better than we found.</p>
<p>This is the way of the gardener, not the engineer. It requires humility, patience, and love for what is given.</p>
