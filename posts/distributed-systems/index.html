<p>I&rsquo;ve been reading recently Distributed Systems by Steen, M. v., &amp; Tanenbaum, A. S.

</span>  And it provides a very nice introduction into the topic. Something I liked really from the book, how it starts with distinguishing between convoluted terms like distributed systems and decentralized systems. I experience this issue a lot while talking in an engineering context and I find someone suggesting a distributed approach, however, many of the listeners confuse it with other definitions like service-based architecture and the like.</p>

            <h4>Figure 1.1: The organization of a (a) centralized, (b) decentralized, and (c) distributed system, according to various popular sources. We take a different approach, as figures such as these are really not that meaningful.</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In this article I will go quickly over that distinction.</p>
<p>To understand the difference between distributed and decentralized systems, we must first consider how networked systems emerge. There are typically two distinct evolutionary paths that lead to computers being connected together.</p>
<p>The first path, which we might call the integrative approach, starts with independent, often heterogeneous systems that need to communicate. This path naturally leads to what we call &ldquo;distributed systems&rdquo; - collections of autonomous computers that appear to users as a single coherent system.</p>
<p>The second path, which could be termed the divisive approach, begins with a single system that, due to scaling requirements, gets physically separated into multiple components while maintaining centralized control. This creates what we commonly refer to as &ldquo;decentralized systems.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="key-differences">Key Differences</h2>
<p>The primary distinction lies in <strong>control and autonomy</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In distributed systems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Individual nodes operate autonomously</li>
<li>Each node has its own computational resources</li>
<li>No central controlling authority exists</li>
<li>Nodes communicate by message passing</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>In decentralized systems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Components are physically separated but logically unified</li>
<li>A central authority or coordination mechanism exists</li>
<li>Decision-making may be delegated but ultimate control remains centralized</li>
<li>Often designed as a coherent system from the beginning</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
