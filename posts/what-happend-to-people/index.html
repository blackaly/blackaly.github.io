        <p>When I try to understand what’s happening to people, I’m amazed at why they do this to themselves. I don’t pretend I’m special, and yes, I make mistakes sometimes, and I have to admit I grew up around people who lived simply and within their means which made me think wisly in a lot of things around me. But what I see now is that people are living inside their minds, what is that mean? I mean people, as I see, no longer think about the consequences of what they do or what I am buying today will reflect to my expenses in the future or not, they don’t have a long-term plan for their <strong>financial expenses</strong>. They only think about the current moment, regardless of whether what they are buying today will affect their future expenses which, in my view, is a red flag for our generation. Our generation is very easy to manipulate and control because of what people see every day on Reels and TikTok videos and you without feeling it or being aware of it, can change your attitude and way of thinking and I wouldn’t be exaggerating if I said your whole personality.</p>
<p>I see money as a tool to save your time, not just to fulfill your psychological needs and make you feel happy temporarily. I think what makes us like this is that we see all the people around us same as we are, so they spend money on their credit cards as if it’s normal, and their lives appear so calm—but inside, they’re actually burning from pressure and pleasure. Companies always need to show you that, and to show that life is easier and brighter when you do what they want you to do, but tbh and you must see it very clear, these companies are eating your money. They don’t offer help; they offer a service. And yes—surprise—they need to sell their services, so they must do something to make you an idiot or control your decision to buy from them. And if you don’t have money, it’s not a big problem: people take loans. It’s so easy—just take a loan and buy whatever you need to feel happy.</p>
<p>Literally, it’s like everyone is teaming up to make you keep buying, to make you feel that you’re not enough, and to make you think you’re missing out on a lot. Like, “You folks should buy the latest version of the iPhone—everyone does this, you little idiot.” But life is not that easy, and if you follow them, you’ll be the little idiot. You must control yourself when it comes to spending your money and try to think about the future. When you buy something like an iPhone just to go with the trend, it’s not a good idea for your time or your life. The amount of money you spend on these things could be far more helpful for something else that will truly make you happier and save you a lot of time—because time is the most important thing in your whole life.</p>
