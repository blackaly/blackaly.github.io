        <p>Reading is not merely the act of decoding symbols on a page. It is a conversation across time, a meeting of minds separated by centuries yet united in thought.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><sup class="sidenote-ref">1</sup><span class="sidenote sidenote-right">1. really?</span></span>
</p>
<p>When we read the ancients, we do not simply consume their words. We enter into dialogue with them. We question, we agree, we dispute. The text becomes a living thing, breathing new meaning with each encounter.</p>

<p>Our age has forgotten how to read slowly.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><sup class="sidenote-ref">2</sup><span class="sidenote sidenote-left">2. Great</span></span>
</p>
<p>We skim, we scan, we extract. But true reading requires patience. It demands that we surrender ourselves to the rhythm of another&rsquo;s thought.</p>
<p>Consider how the scholars of old approached a text. They read aloud. They memorized. They copied by hand. Each word was savored, each sentence weighed. This was not inefficiency—it was reverence.</p>
<h2 id="books-as-companions">Books as Companions</h2>
<p>A well-chosen book is more faithful than most friends.</p>
<p>It waits for us on the shelf, patient and unchanged, ready to offer its wisdom whenever we return. It asks nothing but our attention.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><sup class="sidenote-ref">3</sup><span class="sidenote sidenote-right">3.

<p>The books we love become part of us. Their phrases enter our speech. Their ideas shape our thinking. In reading them, we are slowly transformed.</p>
