      <title>On the Nature of Reading</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Reading is not merely the act of decoding symbols on a page. It is a conversation across time, a meeting of minds separated by centuries yet united in thought.&lt;span class=&#34;sidenote-wrapper&#34;&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;sidenote-ref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;sidenote sidenote-right&#34;&gt;1. really?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When we read the ancients, we do not simply consume their words. We enter into dialogue with them. We question, we agree, we dispute. The text becomes a living thing, breathing new meaning with each encounter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-lost-art-of-slow-reading&#34;&gt;The Lost Art of Slow Reading&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Our age has forgotten how to read slowly.&lt;span class=&#34;sidenote-wrapper&#34;&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;sidenote-ref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;sidenote sidenote-left&#34;&gt;2. Great&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Tradition and Modernity: A False Dichotomy</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We are told that we must choose. Either we embrace the new and cast off the old, or we cling to tradition and reject progress. This is a false choice.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The wisest cultures have always known how to hold both. They honor what has been proven by time while remaining open to genuine improvement. They distinguish between change for its own sake and change that serves human flourishing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-weight-of-inheritance&#34;&gt;The Weight of Inheritance&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To inherit a tradition is to receive a gift and a responsibility. Those who came before us labored to understand the world. They made mistakes, but they also discovered truths. To dismiss their work is arrogance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Simplicity in Design</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The pursuit of simplicity is not a retreat from complexity. It is the hard-won result of understanding what is essential and having the courage to remove everything else.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A simple design does not happen by accident. It requires more thought, more refinement, more willingness to discard what does not serve the whole.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-tradition-of-less&#34;&gt;The Tradition of Less&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The great craftsmen understood this. A Shaker chair. A Japanese tea bowl. A Roman arch. Each achieves its beauty not through addition but through restraint.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>In Defence of Boredom</title>
      <link>https://blackaly.github.io/articles/defence-of-boredom/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We have declared war on boredom. Every idle moment must be filled. We carry devices that promise infinite entertainment. We have forgotten how to wait, how to be still, how to be alone with our thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a loss greater than we know.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-uses-of-emptiness&#34;&gt;The Uses of Emptiness&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Boredom is not mere absence. It is a space in which something can happen. When the mind is not occupied, it wanders. It makes unexpected connections. It surfaces thoughts long submerged.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
