      <description>&lt;p&gt;The art of letter-writing has nearly vanished. Email has made communication instant but has robbed it of weight. We dash off messages without thought, knowing they cost us nothing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A letter, by contrast, demands effort. The choice of paper, the forming of words by hand, the journey through the post—all these invest the message with significance. The recipient knows that time and care went into its making.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I maintain correspondences with a handful of friends. Our letters are slow, sometimes months apart. But each one is considered. Each one matters.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
