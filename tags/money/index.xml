      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I try to understand what’s happening to people, I’m amazed at why they do this to themselves. I don’t pretend I’m special, and yes, I make mistakes sometimes, and I have to admit I grew up around people who lived simply and within their means which made me think wisly in a lot of things around me. But what I see now is that people are living inside their minds, what is that mean? I mean people, as I see, no longer think about the consequences of what they do or what I am buying today will reflect to my expenses in the future or not, they don’t have a long-term plan for their &lt;strong&gt;financial expenses&lt;/strong&gt;. They only think about the current moment, regardless of whether what they are buying today will affect their future expenses which, in my view, is a red flag for our generation. Our generation is very easy to manipulate and control because of what people see every day on Reels and TikTok videos and you without feeling it or being aware of it, can change your attitude and way of thinking and I wouldn’t be exaggerating if I said your whole personality.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
