      <description>&lt;p&gt;Actually I hadn&amp;rsquo;t the change to work for the banking sector before, and when I imagine people in a classic suit sitting behind their desks in banks, I thought they were doing things I would never understand for the rest of my life. But in reality, banking is routine work as I observed until now and I cannot fully guarantee this because (there is no &lt;strong&gt;collaterals&lt;/strong&gt; for these ideas).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In my current job at &lt;strong&gt;ALEXBANK&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;rsquo;ve met a lot of people who have shared with me a lot of knowledge about a lot of concepts and different topics, and that&amp;rsquo;s fired something inside me that gave me a real passion for reading about &lt;strong&gt;money&lt;/strong&gt;, actually the current image in my main page reflects my current focus on money and gold. I still have no deep knowledge, or well-connected knowledge about how money works, but anyway, money is the only thing that keeps restoring my faith that there is no absolute justice in our world: some people suffer, while others continue to grow richer. Regardless of this philosophy, I need to share what I have learnt in banking as an Integration Engineer at &lt;strong&gt;ALEXBANK&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
